# Rk_bill

Discord for support: https://discord.gg/ZCJeT4BAqF

This is a billing script for ESX and okokBanking

This is a free release and i do plan on adding onto it such as making it qb-core compatible, maybe implanting it for some other banking scripts/inventorys, and giving players a option to accept instead of just automatically being billed.

Only certain jobs can bill which this may be changed via config but by default its set to only police and ambulance.

Dependencies: Esx Framework OkOk Banking Ox inventory
